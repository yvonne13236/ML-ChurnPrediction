# ML-ChurnPrediction
A jupyter notebook that showcases a variety of data processing and model training techniques.

Techniques/libraries/concepts used: Categoricalimputer, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, SVM as a penalized learning algorithm for rare label handling, Z-score, Variance Inlation Factor, Cross Validation, Grid Search


Data used is from Kaggle:

Next Step:

Build a set class that you have built in python that can flag its time for retrain the model. Every model has a drift and how you are measuring it.

Build function Transformer in Sklearn. That is when you write your custom function and inherit from sklearn class . Very helpful in real life and saves a lot of time. In last 5 years I have interviewed more than 100 people none of them has talked about it.
